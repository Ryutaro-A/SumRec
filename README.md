>Abstract<br>
>Chat dialogues contain considerable useful information about a speakerâ€™s interests, preferences, and experiences.
>Thus, knowledge from open-domain chat dialogue can be used to personalize various systems and offer recommendations for advanced information..This study proposed a novel framework SumRec for recommending information from open-domain chat dialogue.
>The study also examined the framework using ChatRec, a newly constructed dataset for training and evaluation \footnote{Our dataset and code is publicly available at https://github.com/Ryutaro-A/SumRec . 
>To extract the speaker and item characteristics, the SumRec framework employs a large language model (LLM) to generate a summary of the speaker information from a dialogue and to recommend information about an item according to the type of user.
>The speaker and item information are then input into a score estimation model, generating a recommendation score.
>Experimental results show that the SumRec framework provides better recommendations than the baseline method of using dialogues and item descriptions in their original form.
