# SumRec

This is the official implementation of the following paper: Ryutaro Asahara, Masaki Takahashi, Chiho Iwahashi and Michimasa Inaba. SumRec: A Framework for Recommendation using Open-Domain Dialogue. 2023.

>Abstract<br>
>Chat dialogues contain a breadth of useful information about a speaker's interests, preferences, and experiences.
>Knowledge from open-domain chat can be used to personalize various systems and offer recommendations for advanced information.
>This study proposed a new framework, SumRec, for recommending information obtained from open-domain chat dialogues.
>It also examines the framework using ChatRec, a newly constructed dataset for training and evaluation.
>To extract speaker and item characteristics, the SumRec framework uses a large language model (LLM) to generate a summary of speaker information from a dialogue and a recommendation information of the type of user for which the item is suggested for from the item information, respectively.
>These are input into the score estimation model, generating a recommendation score.
>Experimental results show that SumRec framework performs better at providing recommendations than the baseline method, which uses dialogues and item descriptions as they are.

## Overview
The code and sample data for our work is organized as:

* `scripts/` contains the main model and evaluation scripts
* `data/chat_and_rec/` has our dataset
* `data/crossval_split/` has a json file specifying the division method for cross-validation

```.bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
